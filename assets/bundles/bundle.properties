## sectors

sector.omaloon-crater-map.text2 = Now that there is enough Cobalt, [accent]Hammer Drills[] can be built. These require negative pressure to function.
sector.omaloon-crater-map.text3 = The pressure inside the drill needs to be pumped out using a [accent]Pressure pump[]. Place one facing away from a nearby [accent]Hammer Drill[].
sector.omaloon-crater-map.text4 = More complex machinery requires [#92DD7E]Beryllium[]. Which can be found around the crater.
sector.omaloon-crater-map.text5 = Hail often falls on this place, which can lead to damage to the factory. Build [accent]Shelters[].
sector.omaloon-crater-map.text6 = This hailstorm will last just enough to make some [#9983B8]Carborundum[]. it is made using a [accent]Carborundum Press[], which uses Beryllium and Cobalt in a pressurized environment.
sector.omaloon-crater-map.text7 = With your current resources, upgrade your core to a [accent]Core Floe[] to be able to gather enough resources to launch to other sectors.
