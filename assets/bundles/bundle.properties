planet.ol-omaloon.name = Omaloon
planet.ol-omaloon.description = Planet in the another stellar system. Cold star does not give it enough heat, so eternal winter reigns on the surface of the planet.
planet.ol-omaloon.details = [orange]The best planet of all planets.

planet.ol-amsha.name = Amsha
planet.ol-amsha.description = A star that has only one planet.

planet.ol-set.name = Set
planet.ol-set.description = Omaloon`s satellite.

# region Items

item.ol-omalite.name = Omalite
item.ol-omalite.description = Cold and slightly radioactive stone. Used in energy production and ammunition.

item.ol-omalite-alloy.name = Omalite alloy
item.ol-omalite-alloy.description = Cold and slightly radioactive alloy. Used as ammunition and material for buildings.

###Liquids

liquid.ol-liquid-omalite.name = Omalite liquid
liquid.ol-liquid-omalite.description = Extremely cold liquid, used to cool more powerful reactors and some factories.

###Blocks

block.ol-omalite-alloy-wall.name = Alloy wall
block.ol-omalite-alloy-wall.description = Protects buildings from enemy shells. It is very cold, so the units that hit it with a laser beam freeze. Does not burn.

block.ol-omalite-alloy-wall-large.name = Large alloy wall
block.ol-omalite-alloy-wall-large.description = Protects ally buildings from enemy shells. It is very cold, so the units that hit it with a laser beam freeze. Does not burn.

block.ol-test-joint.name = Test join block

block.ol-low-temperature-smelter.name = Alloy centrifuge
block.ol-low-temperature-smelter.description = Produces strong omalite alloy from omalite and titanium. Needs cooling. During the process it produces a small amount of energy. 

block.ol-fuser.name = Thinner
block.ol-fuser.description = Dissolves omalite in water to obtain omalite liquid by slowly stirring it.

block.ol-hyper-receiver.name = Hyper panel
block.ol-hyper-receiver.description = The best possible solar panel. Produces more energy than the large solar panel. Uses liquid omalite to collect power. Can be used to recharge batteries in daylight.
block.ol-hyper-receiver.details = It turns out that the omalite liquid absorbs solar energy very well, even better than silicon.

block.ol-blue-night.name = Blue night
block.ol-blue-night.description = Shoots charged bundles of omalite liquid at ground enemies, freezes enemy's systems.

###Bars
bar.acceleration = Acceleration
