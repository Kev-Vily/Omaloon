planet.ol-omaloon.name = Omaloon
planet.ol-omaloon.description = Planet in another stellar system. Cold star does not give it enough heat, so eternal winter reigns on the surface of the planet.
planet.ol-omaloon.details = [orange]The best planet of all planets.

# region Items

item.ol-omalite.name = Omalite
item.ol-omalite.description = Cold and slightly radioactive stone. Used in energy and ammunition.

item.ol-omalite-alloy.name = Omalite alloy
item.ol-omalite-alloy.description = Cold and slightly radioactive alloy. Used as ammunition and as a material for buildings.

###Liquids

liquid.ol-liquid-omalite.name = Omalite liquid
liquid.ol-liquid-omalite.description = Extremely cold liquid, used to cool more powerful reactors and some factories.

###Blokcs

block.ol-omalite-alloy-wall.name = Omalite alloy wall
block.ol-omalite-alloy-wall.description = Protects buildings from enemy shells. It is very cold, so the units that hit it with a laser beam freeze. Does not burn.

block.ol-omalite-alloy-wall-large.name = Large omalite alloy wall
block.ol-omalite-alloy-wall-large.description = Protects buildings from enemy shells. It is very cold, so the units that hit it with a laser beam freeze. Does not burn.

block.ol-low-temperature-smelter.name = Alloy centrifuge
block.ol-low-temperature-smelter.description = Manufactures a strong omalite alloy in a centrifuge from omalite and titanium. Also in the process produces a small amount of energy. 

block.ol-fuser.name = Liquefier
block.ol-fuser.description = Dissolves omalite in water to obtain omalite liquid by slowly stirring these ingredients.

block.ol-hyper-receiver.name = Hyper Panel
block.ol-hyper-receiver.description = The maximum possible solar panel. Produces more energy than a large solar panel. It is good to use to recharge batteries during daylight hours.
block.ol-hyper-receiver.details = It turns out omalite catches solar energy very well, even better than silicon.

###Bars
bar.acceleration = Acceleration
