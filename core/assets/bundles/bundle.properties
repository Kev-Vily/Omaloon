planet.ol-omaloon.name = Omaloon
planet.ol-omaloon.description = This far away the dove planet and doesn't receive any warmth.
planet.ol-omaloon.details = [orange]The best planet of all planets.

# region Items

item.ol-omalite.name = Omalite
item.ol-omalite.description = Cold and slightly radioactive stone.  Used in energy and ammunition.
item.ol-omalite.details = Under the action of Omaline, this material acquires radioactive abilities and amazing color.

item.ol-omalite-alloy.name = Omalite Alloy
item.ol-omalite-alloy.description = Cold and slightly radioactive alloy.  Used in ammunition.
item.ol-omalite-alloy.details = Under the action of Alloying Omalite and Titanium produces a strong and very cold material that can be thrown at enemies.

###Liquids

liquid.ol-liquid-omalite.name = Liquid Omalite
liquid.ol-liquid-omalite.description = Extremely cold liquid, ideal for cooling the best reactors.
liquid.ol-liquid-omalite.details = Testing technology.

###Blokcs

block.ol-omalite-alloy-wall.name = Omalite Alloy Wall
block.ol-omalite-alloy-wall.description = Durable and fire-resistant wall made of omalite alloy and titanium.
block.ol-omalite-alloy-wall.details = Omalite is a very cold mineral, which is why these walls are ideal for protecting the core.

block.ol-omalite-alloy-wall-large.name = Lerge Omalite Alloy Wall
block.ol-omalite-alloy-wall-large.description = Durable and fire-resistant wall made of omalite alloy and titanium.
block.ol-omalite-alloy-wall-large.details = Omalite is a very cold mineral, which is why these walls are ideal for protecting the core.

block.ol-low-temperature-smelter.name = Low Temperature Smelter
block.ol-low-temperature-smelter.description = Smelts Omalite alloy at low temperatures avoiding destructive explosion. Low pressure helps to melt titanium and omalite at low temperatures. 
block.ol-low-temperature-smelter.details = Somehow due to the very low pressure inside the smelting fusion of omalite and titanium becomes safe, we don't know how it works but it works :Ð—.

block.ol-fuser.name = Fuser
block.ol-fuser.description = It mixes cryogen and omalite to create an extremely cold liquid.
block.ol-fuser.details = Vacuum pressing proved to be the best way to mix these extremely cold substances.

block.ol-hyper-receiver.name = Hyper Panel
block.ol-hyper-receiver.description = The maximum possible solar panel. Produces a more amount of energy than a large panel.
block.ol-hyper-receiver.details = It turns out omalite catches solar energy very well, even better than silicon.
